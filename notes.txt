We want to build. For this example application, I have set out the following requirements:
    - Weather data should be displayed on the main page of the application.

    - The weather data displayed should include the current temperature, the minimum, 
      the maximum, and a general description The user should be able to set their preferred 
      unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit).

    - The weather data displayed should default to the user's current location.

    - If the user wishes, they may supply a specific location, and weather data for that
      location should be used instead.

    - The user should be able to easily "refresh" the weather data.

    - The user's settings should persist after the application is reloaded
